<p>Allan Hancock College now offers another way for you to transfer to the California
  State University system. The simplified process allows students who complete an Associate
  in Arts Transfer Degree (AA-T) or Associate in Science Transfer Degree (AS-T) to receive
  priority admission into the CSU System.
</p>

<p>Simply choose your major and complete 60 semester units of required general education
  coursework and major-specific lower division coursework. Students who have earned
  an AA-T or AS-T are admitted to a CSU at junior standing with the opportunity to complete
  a baccalaureate degree with 60 additional semester units.
</p>

<p>An AA-T or AS-T degree guarantees admission to a California State University, but
  not necessarily a specific campus or major. So to stay competitive, make sure you
  keep your grades up and that you meet the admissions requirements for the CSU campus
  and major that interest you the most. It is also important that you meet with an Allan
  Hancock College academic counselor early in your decision process.
